- Implements a method for joint estimation of multiple lifetime distributions using the generalized limited failure population (GLFP) model.
- The GLFP model is a five-parameter model that accommodates multiple failure modes, including early failures and wear-out failures.
- A hierarchical modeling approach is utilized to fit the GLFP model to a heterogeneous population of devices, allowing for uncertainty estimation of lifetime distributions.
- The method permits comparison of different product brands across heterogeneous populations, making the estimation of arbitrary functionals straightforward using draws from the joint posterior distribution.
- Potential applications include assessing and comparing product reliability to guide purchasing decisions.
